# VarCORE+

VarCORE+ is a framework used for requirement analysis and verification. 

## Setup

Ensure the following software are installed: Git, Make, CMake, GCC.

Download VarCORE+:
     git clone: https://github/chinkhor/VarCORE2.git

## Evaluation

Evaluate VarCORE+ on cFE TIME (TIME module of NASA cFS):
     ./runCfsRTW.sh  

Evaluate VarCORE+ on axTLS:
     ./runAxtlsRTW.sh

## Automation Note:

The scripts will run the following automatically:

     1. Download ACTS3.2
     2. Download and install cFS or axTLS
     3. Generate feature model for cFE TIME or axTLS
     4. Generate pair-wise combinatorial configurations using ACTS for cFE TIME or axTLS
     5. Build product variants for cFE TIME and axTLS 
     6. Analyze the build result to identify faulty feature setting(s)

## Utilities
- genFM.py: generate feature model from Requirement Traceability Worksheet (RTW)
            input: Requirements Traceability Worksheet (RTW) (see RTW_cfs.txt for template)
	    input: Features to Code Variable mapping (see cfs_time_map for example)
            output: RTW in csv format
            output: feature model in XML format
- genACTSInput.py: construct input file for ACTS from feature model
            input: file name for ACTS input file
            output: construct ACTS input file from feature model
	    dependency: shared.rtw generated by genFM.py
- genCitCfg.py: convert combinatorial interaction configurations to code configuration files
            input: ACTS output file (i.e. combinatorial interaction configurations generated by ACTS)
            input: component type: "cfs" or "axtls"
	    dependency: shared.rtw generated by genFM.py
            dependency: ACTS output file generated by ACTS3.2.jar
- analyzeResult.py: analyze build result to identify faulty feature setting(s)
            input: build test result
            output: (console) build result and analysis
	    dependency: shared.rtw updated by genCitCfg.py
            dependency: compile the product using config files generated by genCitCfg.py
